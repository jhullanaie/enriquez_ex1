                <br />
                <p style="font-size:120%">Love and Deepspace (恋与深空) is a groundbreaking 3D otome game developed by Papergames, a Shanghai-based studio known for its immersive romantic titles. It was officially released on January 18, 2024, for Android and iOS. Outside of mainland China, the game is published under Infold Pte. Ltd., also known as Infold Games — a global-facing label that helped bring the game to international audiences.
                As the first-ever fully 3D otome game, Love and Deepspace quickly captured global attention with its cinematic storytelling, sci-fi romance, and stunning visuals. By early 2025, the game had attracted over 50 million players worldwide, with $500 million in global revenue, 40% of which came from outside China.
                The game’s success is credited to its innovative design, emotional realism, and its strong appeal to modern female audiences. In Japan, it became the most downloaded and highest-grossing interactive story game from January to September 2024, earning nearly $30 million in that market alone.
                Love and Deepspace also continues the legacy of Mr. Love, serving as the second installment in the series and elevating it with next-gen visual and narrative experiences.</p>
